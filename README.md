# Nibble
Nibble is a CLI tool for local network scanning that focuses on speed and ease of use.

Select a network interface, and Nibble scans your local subnet. Lists hosts, hardware manufacturer, open ports and their services.

- Maps each device MAC address to a likely vendor (for example, Raspberry Pi, Ubiquiti, Apple), so unknown IPs are easier to recognize
- Reads service banners on open ports to show what software is running (for example, OpenSSH or nginx versions), so you can identify services
- Defaults to SSH, Telnet, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, RDP, and more
- Can be set to a list of custom ports that are stored for future use
- First shows currently visible neighbors from the local ARP/neighbor table, then runs a full subnet sweep and skips already found hosts
- Skips loopback and irrelevant adapters
